In order for it to be functional and\\nreliable, your charger needs to:\\n\\n- Provide physical power connectors. The output needs to be a USB-A female\\n  receptacle, and for now just assume a basic 2-pin header input. \\n\\n- Convert the ***tech club*** vehicle's 12V DC supply to a 5V DC supply. The output load is unknown and may change over time.\\n\\n- Indicate to the downstream device that it is a \\\"dedicated charging port\\n  (DCP)\\\". If you don't, your device will charge slowly.\\n\\n- Protect itself and the downstream device (device being charged) against high voltage transients and voltage reverse polarity. The former can occur while starting the vehicle and during normal operation, and the latter when replacing the battery or due to user error. \\n\\n- Protect both the input and output from short circuit conditions.\\n\\n- Minimize cost. The ***tech club*** head honchos don't want to spend too much. \\n\\nSpecifications\\n==============\\nThe following is a summary of the general specs and design requirements provided to you by ***tech club***.\\n\\n- Input voltage of 12V\\n\\n- Output 1x USB charging port compliant with USB Battery Charging 1.2\\n\\n- Green LED indicating that the charger is connected to a powered DC outlet\\n\\n- Some form of protection circuitry as mentioned in The Big Picture.

Some seniror members of the ***tech club*** have already come up with a high-level schematic diagram following the general specs for you, but have yet to choose the parts to implement it. Your job is to:\\n - Find out what is avaliable: search part distributors such as [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) and [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/). Feel free also to use online part search engines such as [Octopart](https://www.octopart.com/)\\n - Pick parts according to the listed details below. For all parts chosen, make sure to check their datasheet!\\n - Create a Bill of Materials. A BOM is a spreadsheet or table with the quantity, value, Manufacturer part number, distributor part number, cost, and other information about the parts you decide to use. For this BOM, please use the info categories mentioned in the previous sentence. \\n\\n>The \\\"Value\\\" mentioned above for datasheets usually refers to *passive* values, such as the resistance value of a resistor or the capacitance of a capacitor. Feel free to leave it blank for other kinds of components, or use it however you'd like.\\n\\n![circuit](/blog/content/images/2020/02/circuit.png)\\n\\nUnderstanding USB\\n-----------------\\nA [USB Type-A female receptacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_(Physical)#Pinouts) has 4 pins:\\n\\n| Pin \\t| Name \\t| What it's for     \\t|\\n|-----\\t|------\\t|-------------------\\t|\\n| 1   \\t| VBUS \\t| Put ~5V here      \\t|\\n| 2   \\t| D-   \\t| Charger detection \\t|\\n| 3   \\t| D+   \\t| Charger detection \\t|\\n| 4   \\t| GND  \\t| Put ground here   \\t|\\n\\n### how to search on digikey\\n\\n  1.  Let's take a look at the steps required to narrow down your search when starting from scratch. First go to the Digikey website.\\n\\n  2.  What component are we looking for? A USB-A receptacle, which is a type of connector. This means we need to head to the 'Connectors, Interconnects' section and look for the correct category. Click on the category and it should take you to a list of all of the parts in that category.  \\n\\n  3.  Now we are at the results page. There should be approximately 3,000 products to choose from and 19 categories to filter the selection by (that's a lot). So before it becomes too overwhelming, let's break it down and see what we really care about. It turns out we really only care about two categories, *connector type and gender.* \\n\\n  4.  Select the correct connector type and gender filter (Hint: if you're unsure look above again to see what type of part we are looking for). Also remember to check the 'In Stock' option under Stock Status. Now click 'Apply Filters.' \\n\\n  5.  Now we should have narrowed down our search to around 275 results, but how do we select the final component? Keep in mind that one of our specifications is minimum cost. So from here we can find the 'Unit Price USD' column and if you click the up-arrow underneath, it will sort all of the results by cost.  \\n\\n  6.  You should now have your final USB-A receptacle chosen. Click on it's Digi-Key part number for more information on the component and fill out the appropriate columns in your BOM. \\n\\n### USB Charging Passives\\n\\nRead Section 4.4 \\\"Dedicated Charging Port\\\" in the [USB Battery Charging\\nSpecification, Revision 1.2](http://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BC1.2_FINAL-2.pdf). Make sure to pay attention to the third paragraph in part 4.4.1 \\\"Required Operating Ranges.\\\"\\nAnswer the following questions:\\n\\n1. What is the allowable range of output (VBUS) voltages from your charger?\\n2. In the third paragraph of part 4.4.1, which current line must the load curve cross? \\n3. What is the value of I_DEVCHG? \\n\\n   - Therefore, how much current must your charger be able to supply without shutting down if your charger must support more than 2V?\\n\\n4. How should your charger connect the D+ and D- pins to indicate that it is a charging port?\\n\\nSwitching Regulator\\n-------------------\\nThe switching regulator had been decided as the voltage conversion method.\\n\\n - **Output voltage**: 5V. Must be able to be set up to output 5V. This means adjustable output types are ok so long as the necessary feedback network for a 5V output is implemented. \\n - **Output Current**: Must be able to *safely* output ***at least*** 0.5A, which is the minimum USB charging current. Recommended to go for 2-3A max output current to allow for fast charging.\\n - **Input Voltage**: 12V. Switching Regulators will have a defined input range.\\n - **Switching Frequency**: above 100kHz\\n\\nReverse Polarity Protection\\n---------------------------\\nThere are many [^rpp] ways to protect a circuit from being connected in\\nreverse. You have been recommended to use a [Schottky diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode). Remember that more complex designs will most likely cost more, and that your time isn't free!\\n\\n>To be automotive-rated under ISO 16750-2 [^iso1] standards, the reverse protection needs to withstand 14V of reverse voltage for at least 60 seconds. According to ISO 7637-2 standard [^iso2] automotive devices also have to be able to withstand short ~150ns pulses of approximately -100V. This second case is unimportant as diodes can recover from short pulses beyond their reverse breakdown voltage.\\n\\nWhen choosing a protection diode, it is important to look at the diode's\\n*type, output current, and DC reverse voltage.*\\n\\nFuse\\n----\\nTo protect the switching regulator from large transient voltage spikes. The ***tech club*** members recommend using a *polyfuse*, that is, a self-resetting fuse. \\n\\n - **Current Hold**: 2A. This is the maximum current such that the fuse will not trip.\\n - **Current Trip**: Less than 4A. This is the minimum current such that the fuse will definitely trip. \\n - **Rated Voltage**: At least the input voltage for the charger\\n\\nPassives\\n--------\\nLike we talked about in lecture, many ICs will have accompanying passives\\nassociated with that component. This will generally be in the **\\\"Application Circuit\\\"** section of the IC datasheet. Some datasheets may even include recommended passives (including part numbers) to use. To answer the below questions, skim and look through the entire datasheet for the regulator you chose.\\n\\nDepending on your answers to the above (mainly the regulator you chose and the\\nUSB connection between D+ and D-), you'll need some passive components\\nlike resistors, capacitors, and inductors. For each component:\\n\\n- What value(s) do you need?\\n- In what form factor?\\n- With what kind of component tolerances?\\n- With what kind of component parasitics (like ESR)?\\n\\nOnce all of these questions have been answered for each passive needed, please\\nadd the passives to your BOM. \\n\\n---\\n\\n[^rpp]: Paul Pickering, [Reverse-Polarity Protection in Automotive Design](https://www.electronicdesign.com/power/reverse-polarity-protection-automotive-design>) *EDN*, 2016.\\n[^iso1]: [ISO 16750-2 Standard](http://www.compel.ru/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ISO-16750-22010E-.pdf), *ISO*, 2010.\\n[^iso2]: [ISO 7637-2 Standard](http://www.compel.ru/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ISO-7637-22011E.pdf), *ISO*, 2011.\\n\\nSchematic Drawing\\n=================\\nNow that you've blocked out your system and picked your parts, you're ready to start drawing the schematic. Open KiCad and draw a schematic for your USB charger, keeping in mind the schematic best practices we talked about in lecture.\\n\\nHere are some common symbols and their symbol names in KiCad:\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gaWDUsf.png)\\n| Component Type           \\t| Reference Designator \\t|\\n|--------------------------\\t|----------------------\\t|\\n| Resistor                 \\t| R                    \\t|\\n| Capacitor                \\t| C                    \\t|\\n| Inductor                 \\t| L                    \\t|\\n| Integrated Circuit (ICs) \\t| U                    \\t|\\n| Jumper/Connector         \\t| J                    \\t|\\n| Switch                   \\t| S                    \\t|\\n| Diode                    \\t| D                    \\t|\\n\\nMany parts, including R, C, and L, come in the ``_Small`` varieties, which simply are smaller, more compact symbols.\\n\\n>Feel free to use these resources for [standard component designators](http://dexpcb.com/Manual/standard-reference-designators.htm) and [common component symbols](https://www.rapidtables.com/electric/electrical_symbols.html)\\n\\nFor any schematic design, it is a good idea to start with the core components/submodule in the circuit. In the case of our phone charger, what is\\nthe core submodule/component?\\n\\nSchematic Symbols\\n-----------------\\nYou might notice that KiCad's symbol libraries may not have all the parts you\\nwant to use. For each symbol that is missing, you can do one of three options described below.\\nFor today's lab, please use option **A** for your regulator IC and option **B** for the USB-A receptacle. \\n\\n**A**. Create a symbol yourself from the datasheet (it will help to have the component datasheet open and ready to go before starting). You've already learned how to do this last lab, so this should be a breeze!\\n\\n> **On libraries**...\\n>  PCB ECAD libraries are collections of component representations, essentially. In KiCAD, there are two kinds of libraries: symbol and footprint. Symbol libraries are for the representations of the components that would go into a schematic, while footprint libraries contain the physical pad representations of the components that would go on the board itself. Simple reasons for this separation: many components, standard component packaging, and same component, avaliable in different packaging. \\n        \\n**B**. Download, import, and check  a symbol from an online service\\n   \\n1. Go to the [DigiKey website](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/kicad) and download the DigiKey library. \\n2. In KiCad go to the 'Symbol library editor' application and click Preferences → Manage Symbol Libraries → the Global Libraries tab → Browse Libraries... and go to the location where the DigiKey library was downloaded. Go into the digikey-symbols folder and select all of the .lib folders.\\n3. Once the library has been added find the correct library that contains the USB-A connector. \\n4. **It is EXTREMELY important** that you verify that the USB-A connector symbol matches the datasheet\\n      \\n      - Oftentimes, component libraries downloaded from the internet are\\n        incorrect and it is your job as the designer to verify that the symbol\\n        is what you want. \\n\\nSchematic Conventions\\n---------------------\\n**Your fellow engineers use your schematic to try to understand not only how your design works, but also your design intent.** Follow the schematic conventions discussed in lecture.  \\n\\nAsk yourself: If a stranger were to read your schematic, would they be able to follow what's going on? Follow the guidelines discussed in lecture to turn your circuit diagrams from last lab into a KiCAD  schematic.\\n\\nSchematic Checking\\n------------------\\nRun ERC and make sure there are no ERC errors. Electrical Rules Checker, or ERC, is a handy tool in most PCB EDA programs that sanity checks your circuit for electrical errors. Things like not connected pins, pins flagged as power not getting power, and multiple output pins driving one wire are caught and flagged by the ERC. One common issue is getting power errors, where you have a wire connected to a power input pin but there is no power source pin on the same wire. To fix this, you need to add *power flags* to the wire, and they can be found like a normal schematic symbol.\\n\\n### Final Touches\\nFill out the fields in the title block, if you'd like. \\n\\nCheckoff\\n--------\\nSubmit a lab checkoff on the bCourses site. You will need to submit a pdf printout of your schematic and your BOM.\\n\\nFor the actual checkoff:\\n -  Describe how your turned the provided project specs and diagram into your KiCAD schematic.\\n - Show your BOM to an instructor and walk through your part choosing process. The instructor may ask to look at the datasheets, so please have them ready in your BOM. \\n - Show your schematic to an instructor.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id=\"thebigpicture\">The Big Picture</h1>\n<p>Your charger acts as a USB <em>upstream device</em> that supplies power to a<br>\n<em>downstream device</em> being charged.

In this workshop you will get to try a variety of\nsimple, core functions of an Arduino microcontroller with circuit you build\nyourself!\n\nAttention: If you have never worked with a breadboard before or would like to\nread a well written article about how to use them, check out Sparkfun's how to\nuse a breadboard\n[https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nmodified from IEEE HOPE's microcontroller lab\n\ninstalling arduino ide\nDownload and install:\nhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\n\nTechnically, the online IDE would work too, if that's more your cup of tea.\n\nThe Arduino language is built on a C++ base, and each \"sketch\" has two main\nfunctions: setup and loop . The code in setup is run once whenever\nthe Arduino is turned on, and the code in loop is run, well, forever in a loop\nafter the setup completes.\n\nWant to learn more about the Arduino programming environment/code? Take a look\nat the offical language reference [https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nblinky led\nAs you learned in lecture, microcontroller General Purpose Input/Output pins\nhave a core set of pins called Digital I/O. We will use these pins on the\nArdiuno to control an LED and make it blink at any chosen interval!\n\n> Analog VS Digital: In analog circuits, the circuit \"understands\" a continous\nrange of voltages. In digital, there are only two possible states: 0 and 1. An\nanalogy can be made with light switches. Digital circuits are analogous to\nclassic flip switches, while analog circuits are analogous to dimmer switches.\n\n\nbreadboard setup\nArduino Nano breadboard installation\nIf your group chose to use an Arduino Nano, you will need to install the Nano on\nthe breadboard first. Carefully remove the Nano from its packaging. If you\nnotice bent pins, please let an instructor know. Carefully insert the Nano into\nthe breadboard across the split down the long center (called the \"IC ravine\").\nMake sure to line up the outermost pins with the most extreme holes in the\nbreadboard to allow yourself the most room for other components!\n\n> The Nano takes up 15 rows on the breadboard! If you would like to try making the\ncomplete circuit with a LED segment display by the end of the activity, it may\nbe easier to arrange everything with a long breadboard, or two of the short\nones.\n\n\npower rails (optional but suggested)\nTo make distributing power from your Arduino to the circuits on your breadboard\neasier, you can connect your Arduino GND and +5V to the side \"rails\" of your\nbreadboard. Please be careful not to short these two pins together!\n\nled circuit assembly\nYou will need an LED and 1kΩ resistor to assemble this circuit.\n\n 1. Connect the anode (positive terminal) of the LED to the resistor and the\n    cathode (negative terminal) to ground.\n 2. Connect the other end of the resistor to any one of the digital output pins\n    of the Arduino numbered 2 to 13. If you have a Nano, use any of the pins\n    labeled with a \"D\", which stands for digital.\n\nthe Blink sketch\n 1. Find and open the Blink example code in the Arduino IDE. (File -> Examples\n    -> 01.Basics -> Blink).\n    \n    \n 2. Make sure to change the led variable to the pin number you've connected the\n    LED to. The default value will blink a LED on the Arduino microcontroller\n    board.\n    \n    \n 3. Upload your program by pressing the on screen upload or Ctrl + U. When you\n    press upload, Arduino actually first compiles your program. In other words,\n    the Arduino IDE will let you know if there errors in your code before\n    attempting to upload it. If you want to just compile, and not upload, then\n    you can press the compile button in the toolbar or use the shortcut Ctrl + R\n    .\n    \n    \n 4. You may have a communication error between your computer and the Arduino\n    board when you first try to upload. Click and bring down the \"Tools\" menu\n    (button is at the top) and make sure you see...\n    \n     * If you have a Uno: \"Board: 'Arduino/Genuino Uno'. If you see any other\n       board, change it to 'Arduino/Genuino Uno'.\n     * If you have a Nano: \"Board: 'Arduino Nano'. If you see any other board,\n       change it to 'Arduino Nano'.\n    \n    Also in the \"Tools\" menu, click on \"Port\" and select a different COM, if\n    there exists more than one. Feel free to ask an instructor for help.\n    \n    \n 5. Alter the delay on the program to change how many times the LED blinks, or\n    whether it stays on longer or shorter (this is called the 'duty cycle').\n    \n    \n 6. How would you add more LEDs? Try adding one more LED and having it blink at\n    a different rate than the first one.\n    \n    \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nfading\nYou now have a sweet blinking LED circuit, but wouldn't it cooler if instead of\nblinking, the LED faded in and out instead? Let's learn about how we can achieve\nthis behavior using only a digital output!\n\nfake analog\nHow can a digital signal, which can only be a high or low voltage, simulate an\nanalog range of voltages? By doing something called pulse width modulation (PWM \nfor short). It involves 2 basic ideas:\n\n 1. We can flip the digital output between HIGH and LOW really fast, essentially\n    creating a square wave.\n 2. We can control how long the troughs and waves of the square wave are. The\n    ratio of the time the output is on VS off is called the duty cycle.\n\nNotice that we can easily control the average power per unit time by changing\nthe duty cycle. When the unit time becomes very small, human eyes will not be\nable to percieve on-off switching, but rather just the average value! This means\nwe can fake any value signal we want by simply adjusting the \"on\"-\"off\" time\nratio of the PWM signal.\n\n> fun fact: this is exactly what is done with most adjustable brightness LED\nflashlights, slow fade Christmas lights, etc.\n\n\nget fading\nLuckily for us, the Arduino software has taken care of the hard part of\ncontrolling the PWM signal, wrapping it all up in a nice, abstracted function\ncalled analogWrite (see the documentation for it here\n[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/]\n). It takes one input: an integer between 0 and 255 that represents the desired\nduty cycle.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can use the same circuit that you used for blinking, but you may need to\nchange the pin your LED is connected to with a PWM enabled pin, as well as\nupload new firmware to the Arduino microcontroller.\n\n 1. Open up the built-in Fade example via File -> Examples -> 03.Analog ->\n    Fading\n 2. Change the led variable to the pin number that your LED is connected to.\n    Make sure that that pin is PWM-enabled! Refer to the reference images above.\n 3. Take a quick look at the code structure: what parts are the same as the\n    blink code? What parts are new?\n 4. Compile and upload the new sketch to your Arduino Uno or Nano, and see if\n    your LED starts to fade in and out!\n 5. Once it is working, try changing the code to... * Make the LED fade in and\n       out faster\n     * Make the LED fade faster\n       in one direction, or only fade in one direction\n     * (2 LEDs) Make one LED\n       blink and the other LED fade.\n    \n    \n\nBONUS (2 LEDs): Have one LED fade with a linear ramp and the other LED fade with\na quadratic ramp. Compare the actual lighting behavior of the two LEDs. Which\none's brightness fading appears more linear?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ninputs are important too\nHave you noticed that all the sketches you've uploaded so far included a \npinMode(led, OUTPUT); line in the setup function? We've only gotten the\nmicrocontroller to output something, but have yet to give in external inputs.\nLet's change that trend with an INPUT POTENTIOMETER!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPotentiometers (or pots, for short) are essentially adjustable resistors. Twist\nthe knob, and the resistance between two of its pins changes. Unfortunately,\nmicrocontrollers cannot read resistance directly, but they can read analog \nvoltages through specially marked analog pins, which have an A before the\n(analog) pin number.\n\nEE16A voltage dividers\nTo turn the adjustable resistor into an adjustable voltage that the\nmicrocontroller can read, we can use the trusty voltage divider circuit. For\nthose of you who have not yet taken EE16A (or who just need a simple reminder),\nthe voltage divider looks like so:\n\nLet us call the top resistor R1 and the one on the bottom R2. The output is a\nsimple function of the input voltage (voltage at the top of R1) and the\nresistances of the two resistors.\n\nAs if some miracle, the potentiometer actually implements the entirely of the\nvoltage divider by itself! A potentiometer is like one big resistor that is\n\"split\" into two by a \"wiper\" pin.\n\npotentiometer board setup\n 1. Insert the potentiometer into a free area on your breadboard. Orient it such\n    that the potentiometer's fat body legs are in the middle IC ravine; this\n    will help it stay seated in the breadboard.\n 2. Connect one of the pins on the end to GND (note that this may be easier if\n    you had established power rails)\n 3. Connect the other pin on the end to 5V.\n 4. Connect the middle pin to any analog pin on your Arduino (these will be the\n    pins with an 'A' before the pin number)\n\nAnalogInSerialOut\nTo get the analog voltage value from the potentiometer, we use the analogRead \nfunction (read its documentation here\n[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/]).\nIn short, it maps the analog value of the input (a voltage between 0-5V) to an\ninteger between 0 and 1023.\n\n> Any guesses as to why 0-1023 is the range of values for analog reads?\n\n\nWe first have to make sure our sensor is sending data to the Arduino board\nbefore using the potentiometer for other, cooler things involving LEDs.\n\n 1.

Known as a shift register, this IC takes in Serial data and outputs\nParallel Data!\n\n> You can even multiplex PWM signals this way, if you set things up correctly.\n\n\nEECS151 crew wyaYou can read a lot more about how this works with the shift\nregister here [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/sequential/seq_5.html%3E] \nbut the gist is that a serial string of binary data will go into the system, and\nthe system outputs will be set according to the order of the input bits.\n\nWhat this IC allows us to do is utilize SERIAL COMMUNICATION over a few data\ncontrol lines to control lots of on/off outputs. In our case, we will be\nutlizing the Arduino built-in SPI library and the SPI communication protocol to\n\"program\" the shift registers to control an array of LEDs!\n\n> The 74HC595N does not actually use the SPI protocol \"officially\", but works on a\nserial input, clock, and enable signal, which the SPI protocal helpfully\nprovides (in fact, the SPI protocol consists of exactly those three things).\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt will be extremely helpful and informational to have the datasheet for the\nSN74HC595N [http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf%3E] open for the next\nsection.\n\nAdding the Shift Register\n 1. Place the shift register IC across the DIP IC ravine on your breadboard.\n\n 2. Make sure to have the datasheet open! Find the Pin Configuration and\n    Functions section and use it to help you wire up the IC correctly. The first\n    column is the pin on the IC, while the Target column is which pin on the\n    Arduino it should be connected to.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIC PinTargetWhat it's forVCC5VIC POWERGNDGNDIC POWEROEGNDOutput always Enabled\nSRCLR5VReclear pin, disabledSER11Data Signal, in sync with ClockSRCLK13Clock\nSignalRCLK2-13Chip Enable. Use any avaliable digital I/O\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Qa and Qb or any Q pins on the 595 are the parallel outputs, with A being\nthe first and Q being the last. For now, simply hook up the one LED you have to\nthe Qa output, through an appropriate resistor of course.\n\nControlling the Shift Register\n 1. Start a new sketch in the Arduino IDE (or just stay with whatever you\n    already have).\n    \n    \n 2. Complete the setup part of the sketch as shown below. Make sure to set the\n    csPin to the number you connected the RCLK line too!\n    \n    \n\n 3. For the actual communication to the device, create a helper function called \n    writeSPI as shown below. This declaration should be outside of the\n    pre-existing functions of the Arduino sketch (the loop and setup functions)\n\n 4. To make sure that the serial communication is working properly, make sure an\n    LED is connected to the first output of the shift register, and try writing\n    a 1 to the shift register (in void setup). The LED should light up. If not,\n    double check your connections, LED direction, etc.\n    \n     * Which LEDs light up given an input value can be analyzed with an\n       understanding of the BINARY NUMBER system. If you are unfamiliar with\n       binary numbers, check out this helpful tutorial\n       [https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html].\n     * The A-H outputs correspond respectively to the least -> most significant\n       bits of the value you send to the 595 shift register (using the above\n       code). If you wanted to make the LEDs attached at outputs A and Q to be\n       the only ones that light up, what binary value would you have to send via\n       SPI?\n    \n    \n 5. Once you've verified that your Arduino can properly communicate with the\n    74HC595 shift register, hook up LEDs to all the outputs (or use an LED\n    segment bar) and try to make them light in a pattern.\n    \n    \n\ninputs are important too\nHave you noticed that all the sketches you've uploaded so far included a \npinMode(led, OUTPUT); line in the setup function? We've only gotten the\nmicrocontroller to output something so far, so it is time to change that. In the\nfollowing section, you will implement both analog and digital input features to\nyour LED circuit. \n\npots and lights\nPotentiometers (or pots, for short) are essentially adjustable resistors. Twist\nthe knob, and the resistance between two of its pins changes. Photoresistors are\na special kind of resistor: their resistance changes in response to the amount\nof light it senses. Both of these circuit elements can add an analog \nenvironmental input factor to circuits.\n\nUnfortunately, microcontrollers cannot read resistance directly, but they can\nread analog voltages through specially marked analog pins, which have an A \nbefore the (analog) pin number.\n\n> These \"A\" pins are connected to an internal or onboard Analog to Digital\nConverter (ADC), which is a circuit (that you can learn how to make in classes\nlike EE140) that turns an analog value (typically voltage) into a digital\nrepresentation that digital circuits such as your microcontroller can then use.\n\n\nWhat circuit could you use to \"convert\" a variable resistance into a variable\nvoltage? (hint: think about a circuit you learned about in EE16A. The answer is\nalso mentioned in the following section)\n\nBoard Setup\nYou can treat the photoresistor as a regular resistor, but the potentiometer\nneeds to be inserted in a specific way.\n\nSince potentiometers are effectively resistors split into 2 by the wiper middle\npin, no additional resistors are needed to implement a voltage divider.\n\n 1. Insert the potentiometer into a free area on your breadboard. * If you\n       choose to have the potentiometer facing upwards: Orient it such that the\n       potentiometer's fat body legs are in the middle IC ravine; this will help\n       it stay seated in the breadboard.\n     * If you\n       choose to have the potentiometer facing horizontally: Use pliers to\n       assist in bending the legs of the potentiometer such that you can insert\n       it horizontally. This orientation is usually more convenient with our\n       potentiometers.\n    \n    \n 2. Connect one of the pins on the end to GND (note that this may be easier if\n    you had established power rails)\n 3. Connect the other pin on the end to 5V.\n 4. Connect the middle pin to any analog pin on your Arduino (these will be the\n    pins with an 'A' before the pin number)\n\nAnalogInSerialOut\nTo get the analog voltage value from the potentiometer, we use the analogRead \nfunction (read its documentation here\n[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/]).\nIn short, it maps the analog value of the input (a voltage between 0-5V) to an\ninteger between 0 and 1023.\n\n> Any guesses as to why 0-1023 is the range of values for analog reads?\n\n\nFirst, make sure the sensors are sending data to the Arduino. Make sure you get\ncorrect readings for both analog input devices before moving on.\n\n 1. Copy this code into your Arduino IDE, in either a new sketch or an existing\n    sketch from before. Please change the value of sensorPin to the analog pin\n    you connected your potentiometer or photoresistor to.\n\n 2. In the above provided program, we are taking the sensor information from pin\n    A0 and displaying that data in the Serial Monitor. The Serial Monitor is a\n    convenient feature of the Arduino IDE that enables simple communication with\n    the microcontroller during its normal operation, and can be accessed by\n    clicking on the magnifying glass icon in top right corner of the program or\n    pressing Ctrl + M (or Command + Shift + M for you Mac folks).\n\n> Why do you think it is called the Serial Monitor?\n\n\n 3. Compile and upload the program to your Arduino. Once you have, open the\n    Serial Monitor. Make sure to set the baud rate to the value specificed in\n    the setup section of the code. You should see values appearing on the screen\n    vertically. If the values change when you twist the potentiometer knob or\n    cover and uncover your photoresistor, you've set up everything right.\n\nbuttons (digital boop)\nSimple digital inputs such as switches and buttons are essentially ubiquitous in\nelectronic circuits designed for some human interaction in mind. Both are pretty\nself explanatory mechanically and electronically, but (momentary) buttons have\nan interesting quirk when you try to implement them:\n\npot and fade\nNow that you have a working analog input system, we can make microcontroller\ncircuits that have both inputs and outputs. Let's try it by using the\npotentiometer to control the fade speed of your LEDs.\n\n 1. Merge your previous two sketches (fading LED and potentiometer analogRead)\n    into a new sketch.\n 2. Use the value of the potentiometer to set the fade speed of the LED. You may\n    find Arduino's built-in maps function\n    [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Map] to be very useful.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","send_email_when_published":0,"author_id":"5e40f6300f6e325a8d9d0945","created_at":"2020-02-24T19:25:04.000Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T19:54:47.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5e56d1250f6e325a8d9d1222","uuid":"c0346174-1d2d-485c-afb8-10bf21692173","title":"USB Charger: Layout","slug":"usb-charger-layout","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"# Introduction\\nWith your completed schematic and component footprints from the last two labs, you can now *really* start the design of the physical board!\\n\\nThe ***tech club*** executives want that board done within 3 weeks, so you better get to it.
